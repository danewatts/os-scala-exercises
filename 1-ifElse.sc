// if
// else

// combine them to make
// else if

// the last line of a 'if' or 'else' is the return statement as to why we dont need
// to write 'return' like in java. it is also why we can chain if on to else.

//Exercise 1
//write a method that when I pass a 24hr hour returns 'good morning'
// and 'good evening' as you would expect

def greeter(hour: Int): String = {
  ???
}

////Exercise 1 assertions
List.range(0,12).foreach{hour=>
  assert(greeter(hour) == "good morning")
}
List.range(12,25).foreach{hour=>
  assert(greeter(hour) == "good evening")
}


//Exercise 2
//write a method that when I pass a 24hour  returns 'good morning'
// and 'good evening' as you would expect
// but when it is 12 it replies 'its lunch time!'

def lunchGreeter(hour: Int):String = {
  ???

////Exercise 2 assertions

  assert(lunchGreeter(hour) == "good evening")
}



//Exercise 3
// write a method that when parsed a first name and a second name confirms that it is peter pan
// when given (peter, pan) return 'yes its you'
// when given any thing else return 'no your not the real pan'

//Exercise 4
// write a method that when i pass a 24hr hour,
// returns the following depending on the hour
// 9 - 'you may have breakfast'
// 11 - 'you may have an apple'
// 12 - 'you may have a tuna sandwich'
// 13 - 'you may have melon slices'
// 16 - 'you may have protein shake'
// 18 - 'you may have dinner'
// and at any other time it returns - 'you can not eat right now'

def dietHelper(hour: Int): String = {
  ???
