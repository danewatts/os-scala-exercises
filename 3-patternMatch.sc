// pattern matching

//use like if else if else if else if else
// Pattern matching is started by taking your value and then writing `match`
// You then use "case statements" to compare the values.
// The case statements match will go through each case statement till it finds
// a case that matches and stops at the first one.
val string = "String"
string match {
  case "hello" => println("first if was true")
  case "goodbye" => println("second if was true")
  case _ => println("Catch all")
}
// The _ case statement is a catch all. Just like the else of an if else statement.
// You can give the _ a variable name to use it in the right side of your case statement
// This will still catch all.
string match {
  case "hello" => println("first if was true")
  case "goodbye" => println("second if was true")
  case value => println("Catch all: " + value)
}

//unapply

// Patternmatching can be used to deconstruct some types
// Here we are looking at an option and extracting a value from inside of it
// This is done using the unapply function

val someOption = Some("contents")

someOption match {
  case Some(x) => x
  case _ => "the option was empty"
}

// This is an example of a data model - Do not focus on the implementation of this.
case class Person(name: String, age: Option[Int])

// When using the apply function, scala allows shorthand where you can remove
// the word apply but still execute it. This is syntactical sugar.
Person.apply("pan", Some(23))
Person("pan", Some(23))

def getDetails(p: Person) ={
  p match {
    case Person(name, Some(age)) => s"hello $name, you are $age years old"
    case Person(name, None)      => s"hello $name, how old are you?"
  }
}


// guards on pattern match

// Guards can make pattern matching very powerful. It will match a value where a given
// predicate is satisfied.

val someInt = 15

// case a would match anything, but in this case it matches anything where a is equal to 14.
someInt match {
  case a if a==14 => "number is 14"
  case a if a > 10 => "greater than 10"
  case _ => "guarded matches do not have exhaustively checking "
}


// type matching

// Base type
sealed trait Device
// Concrete type that implements Device. You can say a Phone IS a Device
case class Phone(model: String) extends Device{
  def screenOff = "Turning screen off"
}
// Concrete type that implements Device. You can say a Computer IS a Device
case class Computer(model: String) extends Device {
  def screenSaverOn = "Turning screen saver on..."
}

// You can pattern match based off of a type. In this case our function gets a device,
// We then match based off of the different types of device. This is done in the
// case statement with `case variable: Type =>`
def goIdle(device: Device) = device match {
  case p: Phone => p.screenOff
  case c: Computer => c.screenSaverOn
}

val phone = Phone("nokia")

goIdle(phone)

//What is the difference between method A of matching and method B of matching?

def tuple = {
  ("some string", 5)
}

//method A
tuple match {
  case (_, 5) => tuple
}

//method B
tuple match {
  case x@(_, 5) => x
}


//^ tuple is a function. In "method A" the function tuple is called twice.
// Once on the right side and once before the match. If this function has a side affect
// (Like a http call) that side affect would happen twice.
// Method B gives the name x to the Tuple as well as deconstructing the tuple to
// match based on the values inside. x is then referred to on the right side meaning
// the function isn't called twice.
